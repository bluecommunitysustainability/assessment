How many tourist businesses within the community refrain from using plastic straws?,100,"Florida and, consequently, Orlando, are under severe laws regarding plastic ban in events and venues. Among other plastic equipment, plastic straws are contemplated in this ban that became effective in October 2019. However, according to news from that year, Florida politicians passed a bill stating governments could not impose plastic straw bans over the next years, refusing to get sucked into the movement of stopping negative impact of plastic in the environment. Currently, 10 cities across the state, including Miami Beach, Fort Lauderdale, Delray Beach, Coral Gables and Hallandale Beach have rules governing the use of plastic straws and Orlando is on its way to reduce the use of this material. For example, SeaWorld proclaimed all its parks will ban plastic straws and single use bags. This statement came days after SeaWorld Orlando's rescue operations team performed emergency operation on a turtle, which came in with an stomach blockage made up of plastic.

Does the community participate in programs to source food locally?,TRUE,"The return to locally inspired gastronomy in Orlando can be traced back to 1986 with the launch of the International Slow Food movement, mainly focused on the cultivation and arrangement of regional food through home raised plants and seeds. Orlando’s chefs, food critics, and diners felt their region personified the premium features of the farm-to-table philosophy. In a sense, they were announcing Orlando as the “epicenter of the state’s slow food movement”.
The city is working towards a local food system that includes the entire sequence of food production and consumption, including growing, transporting and discarding. The list of goals for 2040 include:
-	Guarantee access to inexpensive, healthy food choices (public gardens, grocery stores or farmers markets) within half a mile of every resident.
-	Rise local food resources (local food centers, food production or distribution amenities, household parks, community garden plots) by at least a factor of ten.
To date, the city has applied numerous activities to support the access of populations and businesses to local food options. Among others, these programs and policies include the following measures:
-	Creation the Good Food Central Florida Food Policy Council
-	Increasing Food Assets, Including Six Farmers Markets, 149 Grocery Stores, and More Than 700 Community Garden Plots Within the City Limits

The fish was classified as endangered in 1973 and through partnerships with the US Fish and Wildlife Service, in 2010 the fish’s classification was changed from endangered to threatened.  The city eliminated erosion in the habitat of the fish and dams have been removed to create larger habitats for the fish.  Even though the fish’s classification was changed, the city still continued working to improve conditions for the fish.

",111. Does the community participate in any Tree Planting or Reforestation programs?,TRUE,"Orange County takes part in the University of Florida’s Adopt-a-Tree Program.  The program is offered to Orange County residents to get two trees per household to plant on their own private property (Thralls, 2020).  This program was put in place to improve air quality, improve water management and provide habitats for wildlife.  The program offers multiple events for residents to pick up trees throughout the year all around Orlando. 
So far, there have been no reforestation efforts outside of the residential tree planting program.

How are sustainability concerns communicated to tourism related enterprises?,"The city of St. Petersburg, FL has realized that by integrating sustainability practices into its decision-making in regard to the town, it can enhance its equity, livability, resilience, and promote the future of environmental, economic, and social challenges and businesses (""St. Petersburg"", 2021). St. Petersburg has recognized the importance of their tourism sector and have planned out how to improve the development of the city’s sustainability while also supporting its tourism industry. According to (""Integrated Sustainability Action Plan Technical Report"", 2021), “a sustainable city is one that balances social equity and environmental stewardship with a thriving economy.” It is important that the community emphasizes resource efficiency and minimizes its impact on local, regional, and global environment, while supporting healthy and equitable opportunities.  A resilient city adapts and prepares for climate change and other global catastrophes in order to help municipal operations, businesses, and residents thrive (""Integrated Sustainability Action Plan Technical Report"", 2021). 

Sustainability concerns are communicated to tourism related enterprises like facilities, services, and attractions via the ISAP (Integrated Sustainability Action Plan). The city of St. Petersburg has decided to develop a sustainability plan to improve its sustainability and resiliency goals: ISAP was developed: 
-	Help with climate change
-	Create 100% clean energy
-	Serve as a blueprint for sustainability and resiliency across industries and businesses
-	Reduce GHG (Greenhouse gases)
(""Integrated Sustainability Action Plan Technical Report"", 2021, pg.1).

The ISAP can be used to guide the city and community partners/organizations; ISAP informs city sustainability priorities and identifies areas for improvement – this includes tourism related enterprises (it reviews what portions of the business is unsustainable and makes suggestions) (""Integrated Sustainability Action Plan Technical Report"", 2021, pg. 2). You may also see the appendices for the organization of ISAP - See appendix 1 for example. Tourism related enterprises may also contact The City of St. Petersburg for additional information in regard to sustainable practices via different departments – See appendix 2 for example. 

Community and business engagement and outreach is extremely important to the wellbeing of the sustainability of St. Petersburg. The public and its businesses can learn information via the ISAP at www.stpete.org/sustainability. They can also communicate straight to the city organizers and government via stpeteISAP@vhb.com. 

The ISAP team has pinpointed and utilized several tools in which to develop business and community engagement. They have used the STAR Communities objective to spark conversations, risks, needs, wants, and opportunities – ISAP and businesses engage through open discussions with various groups – see appendix 4 for more information.

The city accesses 4 phases of the plan: 

Preparedness: Preparedness activities are those that exist prior to a disaster
and are used to support and enhance the emergency response. Planning,
training, and disaster exercises are preparedness activities.

Response: Response activities are designed to address the immediate and
short-term effects of a disaster. Response activities help to reduce casualties and
damage and to speed recovery. Response activities include direction and control,
warning, and evacuation. 

Recovery: Recovery activities involve restoring systems to normal. Short-end or
short-range recovery actions assess damage and return vital life-supporting
systems to minimum operating standards. Long-range recovery involves
restoring the quality of life to pre-disaster conditions or better.

Mitigation: Notification activities are those that either prevent the occurrence of
a disaster or reduce the community's vulnerability in ways that minimize the
adverse impact.

",GSTC Reference,18. Do you provide stakeholders the opportunity to provide feedback on their concerns and satisfaction with sustainable tourism management?,TRUE,"The answer is yes. Pinellas County, which is St. Petersburg, goes to their stakeholders to receive feedback for the city and its sustainable tourism management.

Then, the PCED (Pinellas County Economic Development Group) works to assist businesses or certain business sectors within their means. The PCED was formed in 1997, with the purpose of promoting economic development and create diverse jobs in the area. They accomplish a various set of missions and opportunities, while also bringing tourism development and sustainability development to light.

In 1992-1993, the first beach nourishment of Anna Maria Island was constructed in order to protect critical upland infrastructure. Since then, approximately 5.9 million cubic yards of sand from offshore borrow areas have been placed as a result of the county’s and USACE’s beach preservation efforts. Beach renourishment projects, such as this one, not only provide recreational beach width for the benefit of residents and visitors, but during storm events, the sand also provides critical protection for structures and infrastructure landward of the beach. In addition, the beach provides critical habitat and nesting areas for protected species such as sea turtles and shorebirds. This beach nourishment management program is very much like a roadway or other such infrastructure, as in once it is built, it must be maintained. The work you see is maintenance that will help ensure continued presence of a sandy beach and storm protection for the upland.

The Marine Discovery Center is a place and organization dedicated to the preservation of biodiversity and wildlife
The Marine Discovery Center has spent over 20 years informing and educating citizens and guests about the biodiversity of marine life and plant life in Florida’s Indian River Lagoon. New Smyrna Beach is home to the most biologically diverse estuary in North America. The Indian River Lagoon, located on the coast of Central Florida, boasts more than 4,000 species and spans 156 miles down Florida’s east coast; providing countless ways to enjoy your time on the water in New Smyrna Beach.
https://www.marinediscoverycenter.org/
Citizen science is the collection of data relating to the natural world by members of the general public, typically as part of a collaborative project with professional scientists. At the Marine Discovery Center, we work to engage the community in the environmental research happening in our own backyard. We collaborate with environmental scientists, researchers, and universities around the state to bring diverse and informative programs to New Smyrna Beach to give volunteers the opportunity to assist with ongoing research projects. The data collected by our volunteers is used to discover the unknown, aid in management decisions, and influence educational policy. There is always a need for citizen scientists at MDC.

Living shorelines are an erosion prevention method that use natural barriers such as plants, oysters, and limited rock to protect fragile shorelines while maintaining valuable habitat. Living shoreline projects utilize native and salt tolerant plants at different levels of elevation to avoid the loss of sediment, help to improve water quality via filtration of upland run off, and create habitat for aquatic and terrestrial species. In areas of higher wave energy due to large boat wakes or wind-driven waves the use of rock may be necessary, or oyster restoration materials may be used to create a new oyster bed while dissipating wave energy and protecting a shoreline

To add to the previous statement, ""Environmental assessment showing all wetlands, delineation of wooded areas and vegetative communities, and tree survey showing all specimen trees, with calculations required in Article VI of this code."" This is a vital step in acquiring new land for construction in the pre-planning phase. Without this step, it is not possible to implement a Green Building Initiative because it will ignore all existing ecosystems.

There are energy efficiency standards in the terms of the “Green Development Program”, but they are not requirements and more voluntary with incentive based certifications. They are not a rigid set of standards and appear to be ever-evolving according to what the environmental standards are. This is based on the City Ordinances.
 
Sec. 26-1103. - Green development program applicability.
The program shall be voluntary and comprised of the following types of private activities:
New residential construction;
Residential retrofitting/remodeling;
New commercial/non-residential construction;
Existing commercial/non-residential construction; and
Land development.
(b) For any new construction or development on city owned or leased property, the program shall be mandatory, complying with F.S. 255.2575(2).
(c) For any renovation of government buildings owned or leased by the city undergoing a level III alteration per the Florida Building Code for Existing Buildings,

As of May 2021, FEMA gave the City of New Smyrna Beach a grant to renovate and build homes that are flood-prone after Hurricane Irma’s lasting impact in 2017. There could be added amounts of monetary funding, but it will depend on HMGP as it is a federally funded program.

",87. Does the community have guidelines and regulations to minimize light and noise pollution?,TRUE,"Only noise pollution. No guidelines for light pollution

Code of Ordinances City of New Smyrna Beach, Florida. Part II. Chapter 38. Article III Noise. https://library.municode.com/fl/new_smyrna_beach/codes/code_of_ordinances?nodeId=PTIICOOR_CH38EN_ARTIIINO_S38-71DEPLAUEN 

Over 17% of all sea turtle nests in Volusia County are located in New Smyrna Beach, therefore there are guidelines and regulations to minimize light and noise pollution. Houses and Condos located on or close to the beach must abide by light rules so that sea turtles do not head towards those lights, therefore protecting those natural habitats. 
There are also noise regulations for aircrafts flying over residential areas, which could include beaches, unless there is inclement weather forcing aircrafts to change routes. 
According to Section 38-72, there are noise regulations that are to be enforced by law officials when the law officers have heard the noise.

“(7) Residents have expressed a need and desire to create a more environmentally friendly sustainable community that will improve the quality of life for residents and visitors by requiring the City to initiate an application with the Florida Green Building Coalition for certification as a Florida Green City and establishing goals, objectives and policies promoting Green practices and strategies for redevelopment that will be implemented through the City’s land development and building regulations. The ultimate objective of certification and implementation is to rebuild a sustainable quality livable community that will:

(a) Conserve water and other natural resources;

(b) Lower energy consumption and operating costs both for private development as well as public improvements and public amenities;

(c) Reduce traffic congestion and impacts on our roads by designing a “walkable” community that provides safe and comfortable pedestrian, bicycle, trolley and other environmentally-friendly modes of community mobility that also will reduce Greenhouse gas emissions, improve air quality and encourage outdoor fitness initiatives to promote a healthier City and healthier residents:

(d) Reduce waste sent to landfills and increase utilization of recycling programs;

(e) Provide for disaster mitigation strategies;

(f) Maintain public access to our beaches and waterfronts using environmentally sensitive design;

(g) Implement land development regulations that protect our waterways, Gulf beaches and Gulf waters from pollutants and debris that can harm natural resources including plant and species habitats;

(h) Continue efforts to protect the sea turtle and preserve its habitat by maintaining and improving sea turtle protection regulations; (i) Demonstrate the community’s commitment to environmental stewardship and social responsibility.”

2020 update: In order to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, nearby beaches are being monitored by law enforcement to prevent huge crowds.

“More than 300 deputies and police officers patrolled beaches, parking lots and hundreds of access points across the county. The agency’s helicopter watched from above to make sure crowds didn’t overtake the sand. There were no beach-related arrests on Monday.”

Does the community have a risk, and crisis management plan appropriate to the community including key elements communicated to visitors, residents, and the business community.",TRUE,"The city of St. Pete Beach has an emergency preparedness plan in place involving 4 steps. These are mostly measures for the local community, not so much visitors and businesses.

“Phases of Emergency Management The City’s emergency organization addresses the four phases of emergency management which include Preparedness, Response, Recovery and Mitigation. Disaster activities can occur within each of the management phases but may overlap because the management phases are borderless.

• Preparedness: Preparedness activities are those that exist prior to a disaster and are used to support and enhance the emergency response. Planning, training, and disaster exercises are preparedness activities.

• Response: Response activities are designed to address the immediate and short-term effects of a disaster. Response activities help to reduce casualties and damage and to speed recovery. Response activities include direction and control, warning, and evacuation.

• Recovery: Recovery activities involve restoring systems to normal. Short-end or short-range recovery actions assess damage and return vital life-supporting systems to minimum operating standards. Long-range recovery involves restoring the quality of life to pre-disaster conditions or better.

• Mitigation: Notification activities are those that either prevent the occurrence of a disaster or reduce the community's vulnerability in ways that minimize the adverse impact.”

This project was temporary with the expiration occurring during the COVID-19 shutdown. The Mall on Duval is to be explored again. The Mall on Duval occurred on both Friday and Saturday nights to help manage the crowd on the popular Duval Street. During special events (Fantasy Fest, Lobster Fest, Power Boat Races, Mile Zero Fest, Key West Songwriter’s Festival) holidays (New Years Eve), marches (Women’s March, Black Lives Matter Protest), a majority of Duval Street is limited to foot-traffic only. The Duval Loop makes 18 stops and runs every 30 minutes from 8AM to 10AM, every 20 minutes from 10AM to 8PM, and every 30 minutes from 8PM to 10PM. Safer, Cleaner, Ships from Key West acknowledges that cruise ships bring 50% of the visitors to Key West, but only 8% of visitor spending. The 2020 ballots allow Key West residents to vote on limiting persons disembarking from cruise ships, preventing cruise ships with a capacity of over 1,300, and to prioritize cruise lines with the best environmental and health records.

because they do not require restaurants or stores to provide information on the individual products they sell. Martin did tell me that if he had to guess, most of the seafood in the
Keys is wild caught, as opposed to farm raised. But that was just his best guess. ",106. Do restaurants in the destination advertise and offer seafood that is caught locally?,TRUE,"While researching Key West, I have found some explanations on restaurant
websites advertising for customers to come to them because they have the freshest
seafood and the description lets the customer know that the seafood is caught locally.
One of the best advertisements I found was from Pinchers Crab Shack in Key West and it
reads:
Pinchers Crab Shack’s motto is simple… you can’t fake fresh. They have always
been dedicated to a singular mission: to serve seafood that has been caught by local
fishermen who have fished in local waters for a local restaurant. Every morning,
Southwestern Floridian fishermen leave Key West beaches to fish in the Gulf of
Mexico. Every night, they return with the best that the Gulf has to offer and that
seafood ends up freshly and deliciously prepared on Pinchers’ tables.

some ways to protect their overall habitat. Their vision included:
A. Continue strategic land conservation efforts to ensure sustainable plant
communities and quality wildlife habitats, particular mangrove and pine
rocklands habitat, and to build resiliency in preparation of accelerated effects
of climate change and sea level rise.
B. Enhance the biological diversity and resiliency of the fire-department pine
rocklands and restore natural conditions and resilience of diverse habitats
through frequent prescribed fire and/or control of invasive species.
C. Restore hydrologic processes to improve water quality, water flow and tidal
connections, and to enhance reef and adjacent coastal habitats, including
mangrove forests, for the benefit of native fish and wildlife.
D. To read a more in depth step by step analysis, please take a look at this link:
Source: https://www.fws.gov/southeast/gulf-restoration/next-steps/focalarea/florida-keys/",Please Describe,109. Does the Community have a program to protect threatened and endangered species?,TRUE,"According to the 2017 report of the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service, Key
West came up with some plans to protect target species that faced endangerment.
Here are some examples from the report:
A. Strategic land conservation and habitat management, particularly with
potential climate change effects in mind, can aid in accomplishing 
recovery targets in these dynamic systems for several of these
endangered species. Such targets are focused on stable populations
with positive growth rates over time, such as for the Key deer (sevenyear running), the Key Largo woodrat (three-year running average for
six years), and the Lower Keys marsh rabbit (three-year running
average for six years).
B. Numerous invertebrate species (e.g., the endangered Miami blue
butterfly and the threatened Stock Island tree snail) and plants (e.g.,
the endangered Key tree-cactus and the threatened Garber’s spurge)
are also endemic to the Keys and their habitats (e.g., tropical hammock
and pine) need to be restored and conserved.
C. The subtropical climate of the Florida Keys also represents the
northern range extent of even more species that are either federally
listed or rare in the United States but that may occur more commonly
in the Neotropics, such as the American crocodile, the West Indian
manatee, the white-crowned pigeon, the mangrove cuckoo, and two
threatened coral species, the staghorn and elkhorn. Restoring
hydrology and protecting water quality will not only benefit some of
these species, but will also benefit many waterbirds (e.g., the great
white heron, the roseate tern and the brown pelican) with important
nesting areas within the focal area.
D. The Service also has committed to restoring hydrology in the Keys for
many years. Federal trust resource species like staghorn and elkhorn 
coral stand to benefit from a watershed scale restoration effort that
includes improvements in water quality and restores functional
freshwater flow to the estuary by removing old roadbeds and
promoting better practices for wastewater treatment. These actions and
others that are already outlined in existing state-federal collaborative
plans will improve conditions for many commercially and
recreationally important marine fish like red drum, bonefish, and
tarpon as well as invertebrate species like blue crabs, shrimp, and
oysters. A large number of at-risk species also occur in the Florida
Keys (e.g., sawgrass skipper, Key ringneck snake, Florida Keys mole
skink, and the Lower Keys population of the striped mud turtle, among
others); most would benefit from the priority actions listed above
under the answer to number 1 of this section.

The City of Treasure Island Government has been working on a 5-year strategic plan that involves short and long-term actions to create a better environment in the city. Sustainability is repeated in the City of Treasure Island Strategic Planning/Community Workshop (Collaborative Labs, 2020). Local enterprises participated in this workshop in 2020, and they plan to create and maintain an inviting beachfront in the area (Collaborative Labs, 2020, p. 33). 
In addition, in conjunction with local businesses, the city commission has a program called Environmental Preservation Initiative for our Communities (EPIC) to reduce the use of plastic (Collaborative Labs, 2020, p. 11). The group also reunites to sweep the beach in the morning of trash (Collaborative Labs, 2020, p. 11). According to Schantz (2020), the city also planned to eliminate single-use plastics and polystyrene at city facilities and sponsored events by 2021. Their mission is to transform Treasure Bay into a flagship waterfront paradise. 
The EPIC group reunites the Treasure Island & Madeira Beach Chamber of Commerce. Its main initiative is to become an environmental-minded community, empowering local businesses and communities towards economic, environmental, and social sustainability prosperity (Treasure Island & Madera Beach Chamber of Commerce, 2016, 1st paragraph). The group also acts as a resource for those seeking to become more sustainable (Treasure Island & Madera Beach Chamber of Commerce, 2016, 4th paragraph). One of its goals is to engage responsible businesses, community members, and tourists alike to join it for a better future in the Gulf area (Treasure Island & Madera Beach Chamber of Commerce, 2016, 5th paragraph).

The community has a risk and crisis management plan called Emergency Management and Preparedness. The location of the city by the beach, in the state of Florida, requires Treasure Island to take a careful approach regarding natural disasters. According to the city’s website, the staff in all Treasure Island’s departments are essential and responsible for “keeping the community prepared for any and all hazards” (Emergency management, n.d.). Their mission is “to return to normal as soon as possible after any event” (Emergency management, n.d.). The Emergency Management’s website page has an informational video made by the fire department manager chief about sandbag information and flood safety tips (Emergency management n.d.). In addition, the same page (Emergency management, n.d.) has links to different emergency management-related subjects like hurricane and storm preparedness and emergency alerts system for the Pinellas County community. Flood protection information is also included, and the website link provides maps, insurance information, and elevation certificates to residents (Flood information, n.d.) Finally, Treasure Island’s city is working on their ‘risk management’ website page, which is their human resource department’s responsibility (Risk management, n.d.).

The city of Treasure Island provides different opportunities for guests to rate the values of their received services. The hospitality page for tourists visiting the Gulf shore (Visit St. Pete Clearwater, n.d.) has a specific page that shares information to visitors about travel recommendations like where to eat or things to do. On this page, a survey pops up as soon as the guest starts navigating on it. In addition, the 2020 strategic planning and community workshop promoted by the city stated the importance of winning the TripAdvisor award for the best beach by 2025 (Collaborative Labs, 2020, p. 2). TripAdvisor collects reviews from visitors, and it's a valuable opportunity for guests to rate the value services received during their stay in the city. Lastly, the city of Treasure Island published resident survey results in 2020 that rate the city in many aspects, including public service aspects. However, it is not focused on tourists' reviews or their opinions regarding hospitality services (FY20 resident survey and results, 2020).
